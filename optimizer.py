"""
optimizer.py: Prescriptive analytics for social impact funding.

This script estimates project impact using a machine learning model and
solves an optimization problem to allocate funding across projects to maximize total impact.

Functions:
- load_data: loads historical grant records and socio-economic indicators.
- train_impact_model: trains a predictive model (e.g., RandomForestRegressor) on historical data.
- predict_impact: applies the trained model to new projects to estimate impact.
- optimize_allocation: formulates and solves an integer programming model using PuLP to maximize impact under budget and other constraints.
- main: orchestrates data loading, model training, prediction, optimization, and writes results.

Requires: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, pulp
